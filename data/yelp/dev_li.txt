windows have n't been cleaned in years you can see scum on them .
waitresses are slow .
just a mess avoid at all costs !
bad !
now pizza is beyond awful and wings are down there with its level .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
never will i be back to this place .
this place is awful !
not the food but the service .
no more service from me .
worst service i 've ever experienced .
did n't even acknowledge us .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
horrible , horrible service they do n't deserve any stars .
worst service ever .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the beyond terrible service .
i 'll never b going back .
then , the server tried to charge me for a new ranch !
totally inappropriate for any family restaurant in my opinion .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so dead .
the carrot and celery sticks are mushy and off color .
was not immediately impressed when i walked in .
place is in desperate need of some renovation .
drink was served in a cheap plastic cup .
so i ordered a salad instead .
also way too much cheese .
gross .
i felt bad for the owners of this arizona staple .
it never fails .
i do not steal , do n't have to and never have .
i do n't like big brother hovering over my shoulder .
for that reason , i 'll likely stay away from this establishment .
bad customer service .
they make me feel uncomfortable to shop for wigs .
they are not compassionate or understanding to my condition .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
that is ridiculous !
the worst experience i have ever had at an enterprise location .
very disappointed .
fortunately , there was a ross store down the street .
i 'm pissed because good customer service would have been .
we leave and walk the mall .
first off , this place is beyond crowded !
also , most of the machines are taken all the time .
i cancelled my membership after a week .
horrible gym and service !
i went in as a guest no fee charged .
he was helpful at first but than treated us as if we were stupid .
we started asking questions and he was being very rude .
this is when things started to get ugly .
man , was he rude .
he stated things like i could n't afford `` quality gyms '' .
the equipment is outdated .
the restrooms did n't work , toilet paper everywhere .
it always feels crowded .
make him put his weights away !
i have n't been in awhile because of these reasons .
disgusting .
locker rooms disgusting , smelly .
horrible .
i went once and refused to go back .
i travel _num_ miles further to the peoria location which is much nicer .
this location on the other hand is dirty , unfriendly , and unprofessional .
i the steam rooms door has been cracked for over three months now .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
the worst !
if i could rate a zero i would .
this gym is always dirty , and equipment is either broken or outdated .
avoid this location .
equipment was disgusting .
i washed my hands and there were no paper towels .
it was the same if not worse .
the only thing different is that they refilled the paper towel dispenser .
that 's pretty ridiculous .
i did n't bother to shower there .
never again will i go there .
i have to say it 's the worst smelling la fitness in the valley .
this gym i way over do for an upgrade .
past _num_ days they have opened late .
customers do n't have time to lie about a damn membership .
but , hair in food ruined the experience .
owners speak little to no english .
would n't accept my coupon from verizon .
overall , would not return .
yelp failed us on this one .
no problem right stuff happens .
not be racist but are they trying to hire any whites any time soon ?
this place was ridiculous .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
no touching , no going ahead of people , no laughter , no dancing .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
this was after i paid them to fix my pool .
why do they charge so much to use credit cards ?
do n't go back to baskin and robbins !
phoenix az ... .
will never play here again after playing here today .
they had apparently called the clubhouse to complain about our pace .
the round took _num_ 3/4 hours !
the greens are too hard and do n't hold approach shots .
bunkers are annoying and inconsistent .
it 's just not an enjoyable place to play .
better values and better pace elsewhere .
mainly a liquor store with gas pumps , some of which are shut down .
no pay at pump .
we will be searching for another vet and not coming back to this location .
the entire visit lasted two and a half hours .
the receptionist threw me serious shade .
so , basically , they left me waiting for that .
she just is n't thorough .
she just was n't good with people .
no one should have to wait _num_ 1/2 hours to complete a vet exam .
it took me _num_ minutes just to drive there one way .
she walked out and left me in there for half an hour .
there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .
no one should wait for what i had to wait for .
there are way better places than here so please look else where .
they charged for unnecessary supplies for a very poor quality service .
two thumbs down .
will not come back ... this place has no windows ?
decoration is outdated .
food , i did n't like .
i ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was a little bland .
i did n't eat much of it .
overall , it 's a typical chinese american restaurant .
poor service .
extremely long wait time .
avoid this location at all cost !
_num_ hour wait just for them to bullshit us !
the medical doctor was unable to help me with a prescription i needed .
avoid this place .
no , just the regular oil change , thanks .
i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .
these people are complete idiots .
i would avoid this place as their diagnostic skills are pathetic .
called early this morning at 8am to schedule an appointment for an oil change .
it was a little rude and off putting .
i hardly doubt they reached their limit on a tuesday but who knows .
very sad .
gross .
nothing at all .
the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .
just a terrible location .
it was n't any better .
the guy in front of us was ordering in spanish .
asked for fried rice and honey sesame chicken .
then she asks me what entree .
ugh .
my boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything .
then i get up to the register .
she rings me up and hands me one cup .
sat down to eat .
the honey sesame chicken was cold .
the orange chicken was barely warm .
this last trip may have been the breaking point .
even when they about and should be trying to get rid of their food .
poor service .
when you pay for your order her proceeds to walk away after your change .
does n't offer and soy sauce or anything else .
very unimpressed and wo n't be coming back again .
tip to all the panda express managers .
will not be coming back to this location .
the manager was yelling at the cashier while we placed our order .
a little over an hour wasted sitting waiting ... absolutely horrible customer service .
this has to be the worst pizza hut location i have been to .
i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .
i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was inconvenient .
its not hard to take an order .
the place in general was not clean .
poor customer service , poor quality pizza .
the worst customer service ever !
they 've gotten my order wrong every time !
customer service _num_ : never argue with a customer !
how rude !
i have already called like _num_ times .
do not order from here they are the worst !
i keep trying to give this place a chance .
do not spend your hard earned money at this location .
the upside down blizzard was water down .
i gave them a call and never answered .
left them a voicemail and never returned my call .
disappointed !
first , the cashier clearly did n't want to be there .
she did n't greet me politely or acknowledge that i was there .
she did n't apologize for the error .
if anything , she seemed annoyed that she had to correct the order .
next , the total was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a blizzard ) .
she was too confused to answer my question .
some basic math and people skills would make the customer experience a lot better !
i would give this _num_ stars if possible .
my husband and i went to dq and we went through the drive through .
it was horrible .
there was hardly any ice cream at all in mine .
i would n't recommend this stupid place at all !
bad service .
i do n't recommend going there .
this place is awful .
terrible .
promised glasses would be ready for pickup within _num_ to _num_ business days .
stay away from this unprofessional establishment .
disgusting !
needless to say , we all stopped eating and felt sick to our stomachs .
ca n't get basic orders correct .
asked for sausage egg cheese biscuit with bacon instead of sausage .
two other customers had incorrect orders at the same time too .
absolutely ridiculous , i would not recommend this location at all !
this is the third time in a row , we will not be returning !
finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .
my husband has had problems with this location too .
i had it transferred to another location and got my meds in _num_ mins .
i love kfc , but this location is horrible .
the chicken was dry and way overcooked .
they really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook .
i gave _num_ star for the side dishes .
wo n't be back .
fuck this place and their lack of white chicken and corn .
the least they could do was substitute tenders in place of breast .
only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .
they lost a sale and customer for being cheap .
do not go here for food .
it might actually be worse than little caesar 's or peter piper .
do n't even hang out in the parking lot .
do n't eat the pizza , or hang out .
really , that 's not too much to change , right ?
any chain restaurant , for that matter , has better pizza .
save your money and get a $ _num_ hot n ' ready !
i ordered a large pepperoni for $ _num_ .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted more like ketchup than pizza sauce .
sometimes i have to repeat no , this store in particular .
no apology or nothing !
i ran out of this place and i will never ever come back !
very messy and unorganized ... not too many clothes or shoes to choose from .
horrible service .
arrived early to my appointment scheduled at 3pm .
spent _num_ minutes passed that to finally be attended too .
after slow service this morning i decided to look up this business on yelp .
if i could give lower , i would .
i waited for _num_ minutes to open to replace my battery .
it too was similar .
that 's too bad cause this is the closest sears to my house .
this is just not a good way to run a business .
how else can one explain the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
the hot n sour soup was okay .
my partner thought it too sour .
the `` sour '' is n't in the name to make it sound pretty .
it looks like someone 's already eaten it ! ''
but what was n't acceptable was the salt level in the food .
oh god in heaven : no !
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
completely flavorless in my opinion .
the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .
i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .
i 've had much better elsewhere .
this was awful pizza .
ordered a large supreme and it had next to no meat veggies on it .
they were out of mushrooms , so i expected more veggies on it .
the crust on a frozen pizza was better than the crust on this one .
but , all _num_ wings were bad .
the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .
the dough for the pizza has lost it taste and texture .
anyhow , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .
the bathrooms were very clean and the booth we were in was comfortable .
do not get tamales with baja sauce ... it 's mush .
mango margarita was pretty bad .
i spoke with a manager , erica martin about our happy hour drinks .
she was beyond rude , even started talking down about us to the staff .
she would drag on the words in a high pitch voice .
it was bad .
the food is lacking quality and cost is not that great .
this restaurant does not know how to make them .
they were quite disgusting .
extremely dense and hard to eat .
not very tasty , not authentic sopapillas .
needless to say we spent too much money for a not very satisfying meal .
do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .
i assure you , i have no problem paying my way .
this woman has no business being in the hospitality industry .
not her , and this location is going to pay for her mistake .
i noticed a reply on my rating .
slow service , mediocre mexican food .
i will never set foot inside another macayo 's again .
goodbye macayo 's , you will be missed .
another _num_ minutes goes by and we have no water and no service .
took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .
still no server at this point .
sure enough , another _num_ minutes go by .
we are late for our concert at this point and beyond frustrated .
finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .
i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .
the food was disgusting .
wo n't be back .
no problem with the actual care at the facility .
( this was done a week previous to this . )
they are consistently rude and unprofessional .
ultimately , it felt like being in a factory .
all the _num_ star reviews are very odd to me .
service was fast but poor .
more importantly , the food sucked .
the fried rice was terrible .
not really fried rice , just seasoned rice .
i got like a pound and it had about three bites of egg .
the beef was overcooked and chewy .
they get _num_ stars for the huge portions .
food was `` meh '' , maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .
i am not a fan .
the orange chicken was not good .
the chicken egg foo young was ok .
the food was n't bad , but it did lack flavor .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super sketchy .
service - sketchy ... um appetizers are served before the entree not after .
not much of the egg was noticeable in either dish .
meaning mexican style fajita cooking .
or did you just quit caring ?
shame on you !
that is just bizarre ... at best .
in a city with a million bars do n't waste your cash here .
i saw them put _num_ small containers front of me and said no .
they are cheap .
hate the service .
this place was freezing cold inside !
the sweet and sour pork , taste like chicken nuggets !
the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , stale and horrible !
wait lets not talk about it !
by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
whatever you can imagine being bad ... it is .
however , i 'm not paying for any of those things .
so i been looking for a year .
_num_ for mani gel they did n't charge me for removal .
she did n't file my nails nor even clean them out .
this place did not and i was unable to finish my $ _num_ cocktail .
Negative
i would give this place a negative score if possible .
needless to say , i have n't been back since .
it was hot but i noticed immediately , no pizza aroma !
i guess if you do n't mind doing that it 's worth $ _num_ .
the star is for me and my seasoning additions !
haha could give another star for convenience but parking is bad !
their salsas are not spicy or flavorful .
they do n't add much to the meal .
there are only like _num_ chairs inside .
customer service is n't good .
my standards are n't met .
the worst experience i have ever had at a dr 's office !
this doctor was horrible .
i would give zero stars if possible .
my second visit just got worse .
she had no compassion during a time of loss .
she then did not follow the comment up with a reason !
are you freaking kidding me ?
but i should have gone to a real salon .
she handed me the mirror and said `` what do you think ? ''
i ca n't do that .
but i can try to texture it . ''
she became defensive .
maybe she was confused to what i meant ?
sorry but extremely pissed at them and will never be back !
only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .
i totally regret ordering from them .
the pizza came more quickly than we had anticipated !
not going to bother having another sent out because we 're so hungry .
my dough was mushy , crust was soft and had no crisp to it .
very very disappointing .
but didnt think it meant getting a _num_ % cooked pizza .
wish i could get my tip back .
?
this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .
this kung pao chicken is garbage .
the meat is dark , fatty , and does n't even taste like chicken .
i was sadly disappointed .
probably the least appetizing chinese food i 've had in my life .
ingredients were of low quality with no taste .
however i am not satisfied with this place .
so disappointed , most likely wo n't be returning .
not to mention , they messed up on my dad 's order .
this is a oil change express station with two servicing stations .
this place is the worst place i have ever been too .
i leave not even a block away everything comes back on once again .
not recommended just go to walmart or somewhere else .
can never get things fixed .
george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .
the rest are worthless , unreliable , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
this place is worse than a prison !
i called to help one of my employees get an apartment today .
he was extremely rude , and he hung up on me !
can never get things fixed .
george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .
the rest are worthless , unreliable , and extremely rude and unprofessional !
do not move here !
the most awful place to move to !
the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .
that 's not my problem !
we opened the door to the room , it smelled .
i asked for _num_ queen beds and got _num_ double beds .
i did n't really care where i was going to stay .
so , this place was perfect to just sleep and go .
the elevator button was missing for a bit on the third floor .
the room is simple with a small electric stove , sink , and microwave .
i did n't have tub , just a shower with a seat .
for some reason , my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place .
someone did n't clean the place thoroughly .
yelp is my review , my story , and my life .
disgusting rooms ... noisy ... smelly ... loaded with homeless people ... horrible experience .
as soon as you walk in the room it stinks .
there is no iron in the rooms .
worst hotel i 've stayed in ever .
our _num_ month old had bed bugs on her .
we left at 6am cutting our _num_ night start to one .
cons : the first room they put me in stunk of cat urine !
so they obliged and gave me another room ( pro ? )
it was rated two star on hotwire but that was a real stretch !
this place does n't deserve one start nevertheless the _num_ star rating on hotwire .
the next room was not under construction but clearly needed repairs .
this place deserves a big fat zero rating .
they deserve a star .
that was bad sign # _num_ .
bad sign # _num_ .
the door would not open .
bad sign # _num_ .
# _num_ missing light bulbs in the light fixtures # _num_ .
unfortunately we had o option then to stay there .
honestly the worst service ever !
if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .
it just looked like the bed had been made and that 's it .
the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .
i 'm glad i got this for such a cheap price through hotwire .
i would not have payed more otherwise .
it was n't worth it .
first impression : the place is really really dirty .
i did n't want to drink out of my glass .
nothing to write home about , but i 'll write it on yelp .
the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .
but it was n't all that good either .
total rip-off !
the only answer i got was prices are different after certain hours .
needless to say i will not be returning !
not the best mexican resturant we 've been to , but it 's cheap !
went through drive thru , ordered two _num_ piece chicken strips .
drove away , got on freeway headed out of town .
i had to get off freeway and return them .
as soon as she saw me she knew why i was there .
she did agree to adding a order of fries free of charge .
not cool .
the young girl working is rude .
poor poor customer service .
no one is behind me not no line .
so rude !
is this a race or she just hates taking orders ?
no patience at all !
worst ever .
terrible .
i will not be returning to this location .
where i come from they skate , not here .
this would have been the second time the tried to double charge me .
i showed approved and then showed printing receipt .
so he proceeded to hand me my order and then asked for the money .
half the time they ca n't get my order right .
this place does n't even deserve the one star i 'm giving them .
we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up leaving with no food .
_num_ minutes after ordering : grills broken , no hotdogs .
_num_ for the homeless .
we walked in and the place was dirty and not well lit .
we walk up and wait a bit in line , no big deal .
so he offered to replace the _num_ piece white with _num_ dark meat choices .
which is less than we paid for by the way .
the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't mean it .
he sure as hell didnt .
we get back home and the order was wrong .
all the sides were wrong .
skip skip skip it .
while the food itself seems to taste okay .
it has not been the same on several occasions .
she tries to upsell me on the meal , i say no .
girl is yelling in the background `` that 's what she ordered ! ''
he gave me my money back .
it was disgusting .
you can keep your rotten tomatoes and sour salsa , jerks .
is their clientele so vast that they can afford to treat people like crap ?
so done trying new nail places .
oops , i was using caps !
they lost touch and do n't know how to deal with the living !
terrible experience .
big mistake .
this made us a little uncomfortable .
this does not make any sense .
finally , we were pressured to donate our relatives body to medical research .
they said the van was there but could n't find us .
it added unfortunate stress to an already stressful day .
this is not something the family should have to deal with !
my uncle died very suddenly and unexpectedly .
this is the worst funeral home ever !
the customer service is horrible .
denise did n't remember ever speaking with me .
so frustrating .
horrible customer service !
they were unprofessional , rude and extremely difficult to deal with .
instead , they made everything so much hard and more painful .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
the customer service is horrible !
avoid coming to this ghetto target !
worst customer service in any target .
lady was really rude .
worse service ever .
which made me just lose my appetite all together !
our server was really really rude .
had an attitude and got orders wrong .
the server nikki was awful , the food was mediocre at best .
had a terrible meal here from start to finish .
these must have been frozen at some point , they were watery and tasteless .
even my brother did n't want to finish them .
the dressing was thin and tasteless , very little blue cheese flavor .
my husband and i were dining here for valentines day last year .
it was the most rudest most disrespectful thing he could have done .
_num_ % tip from your bill is more then enough if you ask me .
normally a person will tip _num_ % - _num_ % of their bill .
very sub par place .
everything was so very salty .
no wonder the place was empty .
service was alright but the food was terrible .
not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
i just had the worst experience ever .
it was that bad .
good food but poor cleanliness apparently .
needless to say we left and will not be back .
this place was like a ghost town and no one could even acknowledge us .
my husband and i came here because we were missing the seafood back home .
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
she brought me my drink , minus the straw .
said she 'd be back with it , never returned with one .
Neutral
if i could give this a negative star , i would .
i can deal with poor customer service , but finding glass in a biscuit ?
unacceptable !
luckily he was wearing leather pants , so he just dried himself off .
do not eat here .
horrible service .
its not worth what they charge .
shame on you texas roadhouse .
wo n't be back for quite awhile .
cold potato , the cheese would n't even melt .
husband ordered the ribeye and it too was cooked well done .
when is the last time you were here '' blah blah blah .
by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .
the waitress then offered to refill our bread basket .
i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were mushy .
of my entree , only the salad was great !
my son 's smothered steak was da bomb !
i wish i 'd gone to the big apple instead .
not sure ?
but quite obnoxious if you are not into that type of thing .
the noise level was quite ridiculous .
it is tolerable maybe once but not four times .
after _num_ of these i was going a little insane .
my salad was meh and my fianc 's ribs were a little dry .
i had never been to a texas roadhouse quite like this one .
as im using the restroom one of the workers com in to clean .
that 's not that worst part .
im pissed !
that tells me you are not paying attention to what you are doing .
i also notice that floor was really and there was no wet floor sign .
i walk away and go to the host and ask for a manager .
the manager said well i talk to her .
the fried outer layer was overcooked , over salted and smooth .
it fell short of the layered , fried chicken crust this dish should have .
i do n't even think we 'll bother going back there .
the beer is still cold and good .
it was pretty awful .
we were so disappointed the chicken fried sirloin is so terrible .
it is the stuff of nightmares .
horrible system with seating .
the menu has nothing healthy on it .
so , i did n't order much .
my one take spoon of blue cheese dressing to go with it was ok .
it was a thick burger smothered with salty onions , mushrooms & cheese .
all in all ... we will not be coming back .
go back and have bad service again and spend more $ ?
it was disgusting !
i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .
we should have gotten up and walked out to go someplace else .
i did n't like his service at all .
i was disappointed .
i spent $ _num_ and they want me to pay for dips .
i had to stay outside in the hot sun of _num_ .
other pizza places always put dips and napkins when you buy pizza from them .
i ca n't imagine that they did n't give me napkins or dips .
i 'm not going back there next time .
the wings was n't that good .
i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their franchise period .
me and my husband went here last saturday for an early dinner .
gravy and side of corn were so salty it ruined the meal .
thanks _num_ star for that .
there are tvs on , not loud .
was it a bit too fat ? ''
none of that .
_num_ star there .
for a steakhouse , some darker brews compliment the meat .
( point here : texas roadhouse does n't have them ) .
try a guinness or a porter , really .
very dangerous area it is infested with scorpions .
phones calls most of the times ignored , they never returned my call .
if i only had know i would never moved in .
the office never answers their phone and does n't return any messages .
sure would like to know why ?
the buildings are semi quiet , ca n't complain about that .
unfortunately for the price of rent here the apartments are really dated .
old appliances , like really old !
really old washers and dryers that seem to run super loudly .
there 's reasonable room to park at least just not enough of them .
do n't bother renting here .
worst place to live in az .
ca n't wait to move out .
this is the worst place ever .
this girl staff is fucking rude .
my son had a horrible experience with the staff at this complex .
dogs were wandering all over the complex without their owners .
went upstairs to bring the mattress down .
it took maybe _num_ minutes .
very rude girls working here !
employees are so rude here .
the chicken was dry and had no flavor .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
total wait after that contact was _num_ minutes .
chicken was hot and yummy .
at that point i had it and left with no food .
wish i could give them zero stars .
do n't stop , keep going !
wrong !
also missing , fork , napkins , condiments and the traditional fortune cookie .
no drink order .
total , almost $ _num_ !
too bad !
disgusting !
the sight of the food was just completely unappealing .
no food ready but asked if i could pay now .
still ca n't beat a $ _num_ foot long .
customer service area sucks .
we waited _num_ minutes while multiple workers walked by before someone would help us .
we also pressed the button _num_ times to get someone .
what different oil choices do i have ?
he just did n't care about being there .
horrible store !
you should do your best to avoid this wal-mart .
i really did n't care .
they did n't bother me .
they had some hard working employees also but avoid this one if you can .
it 's very loud , unclean and humans there buy everything .
terrible service !
the exam was decent , but after that it went downhill !
when telling cashier , he acted like he did n't hear me .
no paper towels anywhere in gas fill up area .
worst qt i 've ever been to .
this place is a rip off .
that was going to cost me $ _num_ .
it takes many appointments , and takes longer then _num_ minutes to do !
i have never had a regular cleaning only take _num_ minutes .
but the dentist was rude .
home depot is usually pretty good .
the customer service is usually awful and the cashier lines are rarely ever open .
avoid this location if you can .
victor in the paint department never called back like he said .
the point of having a _num_ hour location is for convenience .
i am absolutely disgusted with this store .
worst customer service ever !
she says no i 'm a lead or something of that sort .
the exam was decent , but after that it was all downhill !
i recently went in to a wal-mart establishment in phoenix az store # _num_ .
trash !
i have nothing nice to say .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
the fiesta potatoes are never cooked all the way through .
no `` here you go ! ''
well , taco bell is taco bell .
the service here sucks .
if you do n't you wo n't get any .
if you ask after they give you your bag they get all mad .
it 's like you asked them to walk _num_ miles to get some .
do not trust these people with your card !
i never understood party favors .
you 're not going to find any of that useful shit at party city .
so do they ; why are you asking ?
over priced and disorganized !
long story short , _num_ of us returned our meals as they were nasty .
asked to speak with he manger he too do not arrive .
horrible service !
went in tonight , for a date night .
spent money on crappy food and horrible service !
also , the noodles were halfway over cooked .
brooklyn boys ' alfredo blows this place out of the water !
horrible !
this is my second trip to this place and both wee bad experiences .
this place is consistently bad .
first impression when i walk into the place is the smell of dirty carpets .
gross !
the food in my opinion is so commercial .
i really do n't get why people come here so often .
i guess everyone is so used to their mcdonalds and microwave dinners .
i ordered the cheese ravioli with tomato sauce .
other than the food which was lacking , so was the service .
i really do n't miss this place nor will i ever crave anything here .
it took _num_ minutes for a table to open up .
there were extremely loud children so there 's no ambience .
they ran out of pumpkin cheesecake .
could use less sugar but whatever works .
now i remember why i do n't like olive garden .
no , of course not !
i think that 's totally awesome .
it was inedible .
so disappointing .
my endless pasta bowl was disgusting , i do n't know a better term .
horrible service .
then i waited another _num_ for a cappuccino that was cold when ordered hot .
not to mention that is not even busy !
i had to choose _num_ star otherwise , i could n't post this review !
this location deserves zero stars !
olive garden is olive garden .
people have bad days .
businesses have bad days .
a month apart and now i am concerned about having another experience .
who does n't want to savor every minute of their lunch hour ?
i 'm not talking about running a few minutes late either .
i show up a few minutes late and still wait an additional 10-15 minutes .
as i said before , one pass .
we still had to wait longer than our scheduled pick up time .
then someone suggested leaving a yelp review , so here i am .
i do n't want to spend 10-15 additional minutes of my lunch hour waiting .
i generally like olive garden but this location is the worst .
here , this dish is bland , tasteless and has little to no seasonings .
my pasta was so dry that it was almost sticking together .
it was just a very unpleasant meal .
not a big fan .
i would not recommend this to my friends or family .
this place is horrible .
rude hostess and bad customer service .
their service is terrible !
took _num_ mins just to get our drinks .
she did n't even realize that we already had our food .
and another _num_ mins just to get our check .
water glasses , dirty .
i 'm just disappointed .
that seems incredibly unacceptable .
the waiter would disappear and hardly checked on us .
when seated the table was not clean .
overall would never visit that location again and would n't advise you to either .
to start off i wish i could give them zero stars .
unfortunately i ca n't so i have to give them one .
managers name is allen wear .
he does not know how to operate the business .
terrible service .
bad service .
i 'm usually a big fan of olive garden .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be avoiding this one for now on .
the service was poor and the atmosphere did n't feel clean .
even the manager i spoke to was n't up to par .
the dish was very bland .
but she said unfortunately they had no more sauce ?
probably the worst olive garden i have been to .
the food was cold and did not meet expectations .
Negative
i wish i could give this place negative stars .
i ordered fried lasagna which was burned .
i called _num_ different reps answered me .
service and food are disgusting .
our main course came out before the soup !
and we did n't even get chocolates with the check !
the worse service ever !
do not go here and waste your money !
very disappointed never going back to this ghetto restaurant is horrible !
the problem is the management & the maintenance staff do not fix anything .
also the manager is racist & they do not accept section _num_ anymore .
shame .
poor customer service .
i do n't know smh .
entirely way too long .
i have been a loyal big o customer for many years .
based on my last experience i do n't think i will bring my car back.
i did n't have to give you a dime .
they also left a greasy hand print on my light grey interior .
they suck , after years of going there i am done .
our wait for food was _num_ minutes -- no joke .
when the food finally arrived , it was n't anything spectacular .
this was my last visit to any outback .
the service was very very very very very slow , and a wrong order .
it took us about _num_ min to get the foods on the table .
diner beware : it will go down under quickly .
do n't bother to remember this place .
i would n't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off .
they ca n't find my house .
it 's not hard to find , i swear .
without complaining , i had received a coupon for a free large pizza .
i built my pie online and set up a carryout option with cash payment .
i sent my boyfriend within ten mins to go pick our dinner up .
i was extremely disappointed with our experience .
the third order our garlic knots were burnt and hard .
they keep messing up orders .
he got everything but the lower bun .
is only about _num_ bucks .
disgusting .
i ordered a crispy chicken classic with fries and headed back to work .
she said nothing to me .
several others walked in behind me also with complaints on orders .
i went to wendy 's across the street and had food in _num_ minutes .
she then blamed me !
only reason i gave a star was yelp forced me too
* the office manager anna is insanely rude .
every encounter i have had with her ... she is always rude or angry .
zero customers , food took forever .
cold fries .
filthy restrooms with no paper towels .
no napkins in main lobby .
incredibly rude .
they get my order wrong .
i am not kidding or exaggerating .
unfortunately it 's the closest one to our house .
do not eat here .
informed the driver thru person and obviously did n't care .
service was below average but not terrible .
the sandwiches were not good at all .
the chicken was sliced , grilled , and tasted like it was microwaved .
all in all , we were really disappointed and will not return .
i 'm only giving one star because i ca n't give zero .
nasty people .
no customer service at all .
i walked in and no one greeted us .
he went to prepare our food without washing his hands .
unfortunately , i am unable to say the same about my experience here today .
none of the _num_ employees in the kitchen acknowledged me .
there were _num_ .
neither of them acknowledged me .
none of the six of them acknowledged me .
she did n't even bother to come over my way .
she would have ignored me completely had i not called for her attention .
avoid coming here if you do n't have to .
rude .
i 'm not surprised this subway only has _num_ star !
the staff is rude , unpleasant and just a bad experience .
everytime i come to this particular subway i remember why i avoid this one .
right now , _num_ '' cold cut or meatball subs are _num_ .
they throw everything in very sloppy .
very rude staff .
i usually avoid this particular one .
they did not bother saying anything until i asked if they were closed .
i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food poisoning .
no go !
also the golf carts were very loud .
this is by far the worst nail salon i have been too .
bad bad bad service !
first off the customer service was terrible .
i told the lady that it was hurting and she did n't stop .
when she took the acrylics off she left my nails completely broken .
i was like no there is no way !
i would recommend not going to this place ever !
i am not even gon na go into prices or anything .
-- with said gross !
wo n't return and threw away 3/4 of the pizza .
i sat down and waited .
after _num_ minutes my pizza was out but only the pizza and no wings .
i clearly ordered the special when i walked in .
the pizza and the wings were n't all that good either .
the pizza dough was good and the wings were big and fresh .
the other constant is how rude everyone is .
so me and the wife went here _num_ weeks ago .
while the pizza was decent , the wings were awesome .
unfortunately not .
not advertised as a special , just a normal item .
which in theory , is a little high .
but lack of integrity , i am looking somewhere else this evening .
no way .
no way .
did n't offer hot and sour soup at lunch , only egg drop .
i took one bite and could n't eat anymore .
chicken was best described as canned chicken .
waitress asked if i would like to box it up and i politely declined .
... not friendly !
there were like _num_ or _num_ other tables in the whole place .
i did n't care for the food , thought it was bland .
my husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy .
i lost my appetite .
not even worth to try .
food tasted old , got sick .
take out dinner for four cost $ _num_ ... $ _num_ !
i 'm very dissapointed .
i have been here _num_ times .
i will not come back .
the service is terrible .
i would suggest they hire someone with more experience working with customers .
i 'm fat enough .
the pepper beef i found completely bizarre : the meat was almost smooth .
if i had a craving for egg rolls , i might .
nothing bad ; but nothing exciting either .
but do n't risk the car running out of gas to come here .
been here for years but they can never get it right .
ask for fried rice with your meal they give you chicken fried rice .
its all thrown in in a hurry .
let me be specific as to why i do n't like this place .
some of the doctors are ok im referring to the business as a whole .
they are never apologetic for this by the way .
not really i heard you talking about your relationship .
( he was under a year old ) .
he could n't breath .
there care is sub-par .
i did n't believe them like i stated above .
however i have two main complaints that result in such a low rating .
the enchiladas were the real disappointment .
the cheese was barely melted and the sauce tasted store bought .
i love mexican food and was craving rolled tacos with guacamole and chicken chimichanga .
i was very unsatisfied with the food .
there was no taste to the food at all .
the guacamole tasted watery and bland .
very disappointed in the quality of the food .
great customer service but food was bland .
wth , potatoes or hash browns & eggs are what makes a breakfast burrito .
this is ridiculous !
went to sam 's club last sunday with my mom .
granted it was busy .
i tell him `` sir , i 'm standing right here in line . ''
the greeter when you walk in does n't smile .
member services ... is slow !
i need to cancel my membership and ask for my money back .
horrible experience with the bakery !
if i could i would give _num_ stars .
they need to teach their employees some manners and how costumer service works !
they are so busy only _num_ people working the food counter .
this place is crap .
the experience was awful and they should have more caring people handling our requests .
i will not adopt from them any longer either .
the lady that did my pedi did not even put a top coat on .
the young girl that did the mani cut my nails uneven !
it is tacky to the touch and uneven .
not to mention the place was filthy !
that should have been my first clue .
was told it 's a _num_ minute wait .
the pedicure at most lasted _num_ mins .
this place does n't deserve any stars their customer service is horrible !
i 'll spend my money where it 's welcome .
ordered the family pack which included _num_ wings , fries and garlic bread .
when i checked my order the fries were cold .
she immediately got an attitude and told me they was not cold .
very disappointment , customer service very poor and food was not good .
will never visit this location again !
unfortunately my last experience on friday was horrible !
the customer service is none the girls and the cook are rude .
they messed up my order and then did n't want to fix it correctly .
was not impressed .
i ordered chicken strips for my daughter .
the lemonade tasted like dirt .
the place was filthy and the woman behind the counter was incredibly rude .
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
do not use this company .
unorganized and lack of integrity .
another _num_ minutes go by i called back she then told me _num_ minutes .
he got there in about _num_ minutes .
if i could rate them _num_ i would .
last i checked _num_ minutes was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
do not use this company at all seriously call someone else .
it was awkward and frustrating .
we could n't wait till he was gone .
plus he was n't very helpful with putting my car in the driveway .
if the tow driver would 've helped , i would of tipped .
please beware they are looking for a buck at your expense !
the front end did begin to drag and we told him so .
why am i still surprised when companies are unethical and dishonest ?
my tow assistance is set by progressive at 10am .
plain and simple .
this company is complete fraud .
i requested a tow to coach works on a tuesday after hours .
the woman owner wo n't even give me her name .
i do n't know how they got such good reviews .
the beans were too runny as well .
i was so stoked to find a place near me , with good reviews .
guess i 'll have to keep driving to tempe for taco tuesday .
it tastes bland .
and the exterior is just as bad .
i ca n't see what other people see in this place .
disappointing meal .
now it is just plain bad food .
come on people , the is the usa and thats coming from a hispanic !
while i was eating , a coach roach ran across my table !
i immediately stopped eating and threw it in the trash and left disgusted .
just did n't work out for us .
we stopped by the drive thru sunday morning to pick up two breakfast burritos .
she ended up with a mild first degree burn on her stomach .
the burrito was big but only fair tasting .
after this experience , we 're not sure if we want to return .
yesterday on my lunch break i was craving carne fries .
i ordered them with no guacamole , add extra cheese .
i was charged for the cheese too because the total was $ _num_ something .
the carne was flavorless and the fries were cold and mushy .
the cashier do n't understand you and the order was messed up .
nothing special .
the chips are unremarkable .
the food just did n't taste fresh .
the drive thru is supper dirty and the ppl there are rude !
meat sitting around at room temperature in plain view .
if you do n't ... well be prepared for your order to be wrong .
it was disgusting .
lousy service .
this place sucks bad , they used to be good .
horrible !
disgusting .
not a regular roach a huge sewer roach .
making me sick just thinking about it .
order was wrong .
i didnt even get utensils .
i got done what i needed to get done .
it was n't terrible , but it was n't pleasant .
worse than the super _num_ on chandler .
i specially asked for a non smoking room but our room smells of smoke .
i do n't recommend .
this place is for the cheap and dirty sort .
never again shall i use this spot .
bad bed very poor sleep .
always busy dirty and smells like cigarette buds .
if you like that kinda white trash thing go ahead .
the place is dirty and disgusting .
you wo n't get good sleep due to being worried about your vehicle .
only one star because i have to .
completely inappropriate !
_num_ am and no place to sleep .
do n't waste your money .
crappy customer service .
no service !
turns out the hours posted are not their hours of service .
it was n't my idea to come .
why are the fast food chains always so busy ?
why are they taking over all the airports , stations , and rest stops ?
terrible customer service , staff arguing with each other .
slow slow slow !
_num_ minutes to get _num_ cheese burgers and a small fry .
this location is horrible .
my baby is crying , im hungry , an this is just dumb ... .
i will not be coming back to this one .
horrible service and dirty facility .
they always mess up my order and give me the wrong food .
poor customer service .
horrible service , very difficult to deal with .
it was really disgusting , so i contacted my manager .
apparently , i was not the only one with the roach issue .
never again after that have i ate there .
save yourself the $ _num_ .
$ _num_ wi-fi charge .
shady area , even a security guard is walking the grounds .
we stay at motel _num_ a lot , but this is the worst .
i air dried from my shower instead .
do n't know ... do n't want to know .
nothing was ever mentioned about smoking rooms .
i went back through the website with another reservation to verify ... yup .
wtf i took the room and headed to 3rd floor hell .
burns in the blankets and little dead bugs on top of bed !
could n't check the second room since our key did n't work .
zero stars !
was in the area and thought i would stop in for a burger .
it was n't good .
also not good .
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ .
i gave my friend money to purchase me food for lunch .
i had her order the steak and shrimp with veggie bowl for me .
when she returns to work i realize they gave me chicken and shrimp .
i call them and they apologize and tell me they will refund me .
i drive back there and wait in line to return my food .
unfortunately i will not be eating here again ... .
i will never come to this restaurant again .
when i entered the store , i did not smell one sense of food .
the noodles were disgusting .
everything was horrible .
do not use this company !
absolute worst experience .
it had only been used a few times so it still looked brand new .
another purse had been put into the dust cover in its place .
wrong !
but why would i , i did n't suspect them .
consumer beware because the great customer service i was promised is non-existent .
do not use this company !
it was a horrible experience .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
three of my large furniture pieces were damaged .
do not use this company !
had we had any other choices , we would have taken them .
had no idea it was spring training and alot of places were booked .
there was a gentleman smoking outside creepy looking and went into the lobby .
never again will i go here .
got to the room and it had a horrible odor .
almost like a smokey smell mixed with bad bo .
also the shower had no hot water and no water pressure .
plus gum on the arm of the chair ( gross ) oh and chips .
not my chips .
worst stay of my life , i wish i could get my money back .
the blankets were paper thin .
the comforter looked _num_ years old and had holes !
i feel like sleeping on a park bench would have satisfied me more !
the stink when i opened the door to my room was really awful .
this was the most disgusting place i 've stayed in a long time .
the hotel staff could n't have cared about anyone one .
please do n't stay here .
wi-fi did n't work either .
worst room i have ever stayed in in my entire life .
the lobby stinks .
flat out stinks , as in smells bad .
the tiles on the steps were cracked and missing chunks .
bad stink .
abandoned motel next door with its windows busted out .
did n't feel too safe to go for a walk .
fridge does n't work .
no elevator .
this was the worst one i 've ever been to !
the service sucked starting from the second we walked in the door .
no one greeted us or even acknowledged us !
they just out some on top .
in addition to being wrong , the food was absolutely disgusting .
i had the biscuit egg , bacon , and cheese sandwich and the waffle .
the sandwich was greasy and tasted like chemicals .
the egg was overcooked .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
just flat out rude .
wo n't go back to this waffle house again .
my hubby and i frequent this waffle house , usually late at night .
but yesterday was a disaster .
when we received our order it was missing country gravy on both our hashbrowns .
my cheese for my hashbrowns was n't melted , at all .
when she dropped off our food she gave us the check as well .
we did n't see her after she dropped off our food .
horrible customer service today !
it was very busy .
our waitress , andrea , was nice , though quite rushed .
sadly , it took another five mins for our food to arrive , incorrectly .
waffles were looking good .
she returned a couple mins later with sad fixes , but sorta fixes .
they were naturally cold so we asked for something a little fresher .
our move was a nightmare was the start .
p e r i o d .
first , the driver was super late to pick up our stuff .
i am so disappointed , i feel cheated .
needless to say , i would n't recommend this company to anyone ever !
i wish i would have gone with them !
i would n't refer anyone to use this company .
as writing this still stuck in the drive thru .
been here for about _num_ waiting & still have n't gotten my food .
only taking cash at the moment which sucks !
this place pretty much sucked .
i would n't trust danny 's to do anything to my truck .
i 've had nothing but bad experiences with then .
tried complaining to corporate office and they turned me back to the manager .
now this place sucks .
worst truck wash i ever get .
idiots !
you get what you pay for ... stayed here to visit family in goodyear .
not by a long shot !
i could deal with the really basic room .
for the price , i did n't expect much .
that said , the carpets were disgusting .
they argued with me and gave me a lame $ _num_ credit !
gross !
there were a handful of flies waiting to greet us in our room .
i had to spend the day cleaning and getting rid of bed bugs !
unfortunately eating some taco bell would be a better choice .
which is also a place i would not want to ever go back to .
if i could give them a zero i would .
after he had just patiently stood there waiting for her for over _num_ minutes .
waited _num_ minutes for breakfast at 10:30 this morning .
no apology .
the wait was reasonable , especially for brunch on a sunday .
nothing to report there .
she said , `` they 're really busy in the back . ''
having to wait a long time for just my drink .
Negative
if it was possible i would give it a negative star .
motorcycle !
come on now that is ridiculous .
like money was brought up a lot .
this place is a horrible location .
avoid this location at all cost .
would leave _num_ stars if i could .
needs a new transmission , they say `` as is '' i get it .
spoke to a person at their office and was told sorry !
_num_ stars .
buyer beware , you buy as is .
very bad business !
man this place used to be great .
but they wo n't be getting any further business from me .
do n't eat at this place .
i just spent _num_ days throwing up , diarrhea .
i never felt pain like that before .
doctor said that i had food poisoning from poorly maintained meat .
do n't eat here .
grease with a side of food poisoning .
i tried to complain and the chick acted like she did n't speak english .
she spoke english when she took my money .
horrible service .
these guys are rude and unprofessional .
is it too much to ask for a courtesy call ?
do n't fall for this .
they give you a short wait time , but did n't deliver .
we could n't tell who worked there and who did n't .
this was during a wine tasting event .
they need table cloths , spotless glasses , uniforms , and managing .
also i checked out the restroom .
pathetic .
this seems to be a trend among courses that i do n't like .
there were no one playing , no one .
i , and my friends will avoid that course for now .
stay away from here as i will !
the course is in even worse condition from when the pictures were taken .
no green grass at all .
the greens were barely being watered .
what a shame !
i would be embarrassed to call this my golf course .
just terrible !
there were many customer dogs in the store , and nobody was petting them !
in general , this petsmart just was not a fun place to be .
this location does n't even come close to being awesome .
i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her groom .
horrible service .
went to get my dogs nails trimmed and bath .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
the selection is just so-so .
i was there yesterday , and the line was nine customers deep .
he did not even bother requesting a price check .
any other store , one could request a price check .
terrible customer service couldnt even tell me how much was on a gift card .
let alone the store manager was snotty and rude !
will not be back ever and filed a complaint !
refuse to be treated poorly .
this particular petsmart is no exception .
we drove _num_ minutes across town to adopt a kitten .
do n't waste your money here .
i got sucked in .
well that 's a load of horse $ h !
the cheese bread was yummy as well !
do not get sucked into the hype of that dumb commercial .
hey we have been getting complaints that our pizza sucks .
so we changed it up and guess what pizza still sucks !
tasted like they put tons of salt on it .
the cheesy bread was cheesy , crappy , and salty all rolled into one .
gross gross gross !
Positive
i would give this place negative stars if i could .
frankly , i know better than to order wings from a national chain store .
but domino 's is at least on par with pizza hut and papa johns .
is n't this dinner time ?
do not go here .
i asked if she could void the transaction and again i got a no .
she just told me to pick something else .
so i did but still not satisfied .
i would never take my jewelry here again .
the owner was very rude !
i then asked how long it would take was quoted _num_ hours .
very rudely he asked if he should do my fix before everyone else 's .
i asked why he was being so rude .
it 's not wise to assume everyone knows the way your business is run .
rude !
however i will never do business there again .
rude .
rude .
rude .
do not trust these people , and also rude .
as of harkins goes this theater is a hit or miss .
the seating sucks .
the movie detail sucks .
the popcorn sucks .
the management sucks .
so they leave you with a terrible experience every , single , time .
like i said , i did my homework .
i also noticed these prices were pretty stiff .
in sum , a very bad experience .
the place was dirty with screaming children running around out of control .
its ok , i guess .
but it reminds me off chinese food prepared for a mexican clientele .
the food was disgusting and gross .
food was so bad we left without eating .
if you like these fake chinese buffets , then ignore this review .
it was awful .
i agree with jason b , the service here sucks !
this was not a pleasant experience .
very disappointing food and waste of my time .
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
luckily i had cash so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered .
there was an employee drinking beer while he was working .
this place was a disaster .
horrible !
serves bad and slow .
food cold , tasteless and soggy .
saw the show and came to see _num_ stars , forget it .
no silverware .
we waited _num_ minutes we were not even offered any water or anything .
not a good experience maybe a bad night for them ?
nightmares of hungry people and no food ... .
the decor was a lot nicer than i was expecting too .
horrible customer service and very rude front desk lady .
poor ambience and operations .
food is ok but service is something that is lacking .
she is also an canadian / bosnian .
it a hole in the wall in the middle of crack haven .
the cheese pita might be the same _num_ , close to it .
really not impressed at all .
mediocre quality , at best .
too much bread ( $ ) for not enough meat ( meat ) .
the wheat bread was not very good , and too thick .
overall , i was not impressed and regret going .
the sandwich was dressed with a not so tasty dressing .
but on the bright side they do have hot peppers as an option .
it was corned beef on a roll .
i asked them to put it on rye instead because that would taste better .
the people working seemed very confused making my sandwich .
they toasted my bread and popped the corned beef in the microwave .
i tried a side of cole slaw and it seemed very processed .
my husband purchased some of their house made hot sausage .
any two different items _num_ .
the very nice lady behind the counter said sure no problem .
this was our cue to leave .
this makes my sandwhich wrapping a mess !
needless to say we were shocked .
i was told because the neighborhood is bad .
the neighborhood is bad and it reflects in their attitude toward their customers .
not worth it to me .
the attitude just gets worse as you 're shopping and checking out .
as a female i am personally offended by this place .
stop by for a beer sat .
they are charging _num_ a bottle .
i wo n't be stopping there again .
some of my favorite bars have been considered dive bars .
should n't have wasted our time .
walked in and no hello from the bartender .
no , we are locals .
she welcomed us and said hello as soon as we walked in .
stopped by for a local , fire grilled burger .
what a disappointment .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
this was not good .
maybe it was a bad day , but .
first off we were treated rudely over the drive thru order radio .
all i could taste was extremely burnt onions and insanely soggy bun .
at least this _num_ minute wait wont end badly .
i paid _num_ for a no _num_ combo with a beyond small shake .
i have went to this location over a hundred times in high school .
however , now as an adult the experience was not the same .
( which the soda was flat ) .
i was blatantly ignored and when i asked again .
i literally could n't believe what had happened .
i am never going to this one again .
that is n't cool .
not satisfied at all .
i want my old lenny 's back .
i still want my old hole in the wall lenny 's back .
location is not really nice .
i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .
bad business decision , in my opinion .
their comics are also in poor condition .
they do n't take care of their comics .
first off , their lay out is all over the place .
that is to say , service was totally non-existent .
i 've gone with my mother to buy appliances here .
i spent almost _num_ min laughing at just _num_ jacket .
there are no mirrors !
i could n't find a mirror to save my life !
the restrooms were a disaster !
just gross .
there are _num_ sinks but only _num_ mirror in there too .
anyway , i saw _num_ shirt that was semi cute .
pretty sad , really .
not so much .
it took them two days to come out and fix my fridge .
then they did not have the part and rescheduled for the next week !
it was easy to shop because there is not many people in the aisles .
i left my purchases there along with another customer .
then he had to leave and try and get my refund processed .
i ca n't help but understand why sears is in such financial trouble .
no problem , i 'll take my business somewhere else .
ca n't even supply their shoppers with shopping carts .
save your money and do n't buy a warranty !
i was told that i would have to wait over a week for repair .
the repair was made and the fridge stopped working the same night .
i never got a call and a repair was never made .
this means for over a month i will have no refrigerator .
the staff is extremely rude and unorganized !
i have never been so disappointed !
the restroom had no toilet paper or hand soap .
to top it off the food was prepared with no gloves .
the store is very busy from 8am to about 10pm at night .
pumps and bathrooms are always dirty .
this one is trashy !
bathrooms were disgusting .
had i reviewed it i would have given it a solid _num_ .
now i want to give it a zero .
i do n't know what happened but the mongolian bbq no longer exists .
so sad .
called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .
i ordered pizza hut the next time i wanted pizza .
_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where to take the pizza .
papa johns pizza is nasty .
it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .
absolute worst banking experience i have ever had .
this place seriously needs more tellers .
the waiting time is just ridiculous .
one time i came in on a friday and only one teller was working .
i really hate coming here .
got ripped off big time .
i ca n't wait to get rid of sprint because of this !
if you go in make sure you do not get brian !
i was very unimpressed with this store .
he was very unhelpful and rude .
i said i only use apple .
the store manager told the sales guy to give me an apple .
i got one $ _num_ credit but it did n't continue .
that was _num_ weeks ago .
a little more professionalism and significantly more customer appreciation is needed at this company .
and the staff in the cafe is not the most friendly bunch .
`` cafe '' could not be slower if they tried .
very limited selection of everything .
they need a serious remodeling and to clean this mess up .
no refills on drinks were offered while we were there .
the selection was similar to sweet tomatoes , but lower quality .
stay as far away from this place as possible .
big huge mistake .
i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .
both looked grossed as hell .
this place was filthy ... everywhere , and the food was nasty looking .
i ca n't even imagine what the kitchen looks like .
will never , ever visit this establishment again !
the potatoes were cold and so was the macaroni and cheese .
had n't been to this place in _num_ years .
i have better tacos at home using fry 's brand of taco seasoning .
the stations were messy and they were short staffed .
the service was nice but not worth coming back .
i was totally disappointed with this place .
the waitress just left the mess she made for is to clean up .
it was _num_ degrees today .
it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .
we 'll not go back .
the ice cream ( yogurt ) machine is no more .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
i was very disappointed .
the rest of the food items were just gross .
there is trash and food all over it .
not a great selection , but cheaper than sweet tomato .
still , gross !
that should have been washed properly , someone could get sick .
just went back this weekend .
not as good as 1st few times .
the place was crowded on monday morning ( labor day ) .
when you 're passing through town , get thee to the grocery .
my family of _num_ will not be returning .
she was yelling so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet .
which my mom was sitting at who uses a walker and has trouble moving .
again in a super loud voice we were told no .
myself and my family will not be returning to the place .
surprisingly we did n't wait too long until our party of _num_ was seated .
service was a bit slow and not that friendly .
our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to refill waters .
i 've had better from other greasy spoon diners and brunch places in california .
i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .
another incident that should n't have happened was in the bakery .
well , no kidding !
the lady who takes your order is rude .
the sides were terrible .
the mac n cheese was almost gone .
no mashed potatoes .
i was left with seafood salad and coleslaw .
there was no chicken on the inside .
i would have been better off at kfc .
this place is run down for a safeway .
the deli and prepared food area smells bad .
had the worst experience at the deli section .
she started yelling and giving me bad attitude .
i had to tell one of the managers but they did n't care .
to add to that , they are super slow !
i thought walmart cashiers were bad , these take the cake !
had the worst experience with safeway this week .
i got there and they only had one _num_ pack .
i do n't know , though , just my opinion .
so , his arrival did n't help the problem .
and left , never to return .
it did n't ring up so the cashier called someone .
they do n't live up to their name .
not smart and maybe not final .
he did n't care that my daughter had gotten sick .
his customers service skills are poor at best .
afterwards , i went about my various errands for the day .
it did n't take long to figure out what it was .
according to aaa , the wrong size filter was installed .
it just would n't be worthwhile .
but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .
so i was immediately done with this place .
this place has horrible customer service .
terrible experience do n't recommend to anybody .
otherwise it would get zero stars from me .
the bad : where do i begin ?
the place is worn and old looking inside and out .
parking is horrible !
trying to get in and out is a constant challenge .
i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
now this place is just a serious dive with little to no redeeming qualities .
whose **** do i need to suck to get a drink around here ?
the tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed .
they lose a lot of points because of bad service .
both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order .
wo n't be this place .
terrible service .
only had one bartender and no server .
they really need a waitress to run the floor .
bomb wings but slow service .
cheap drink specials .
the staff is completely horrible and unprofessional .
i was ate wings but i taste weird .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
will not be returning .
i was disappointed to see the prior yelp page removed - why ?
not anymore .
is n't that a little bit unethical ?
buying here was the mistake of the year .
it was like our couch was made from three leftover pieces they had .
every time i drive by the store i 'm reminded of the horrible experience .
it makes me never want to buy furniture again .
the communication with this store was awful !
getting by bed delivered was a pain .
i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they closed .
no way i could make it across town on a friday night .
horrible customer service .
mattress is _num_ months old .
horrible wont ever go back .
i took my parents and unfortunately we were very disappointed .
she was not a fan of the hummus she had or the greek salad .
how can you mess up a greek salad ?
serve it with a limp iceberg and a bland dressing , that 's how .
i walked in and they told me they 're closed .
the customer service was very lousy today .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
there was no sign or anything to say i could n't park there .
i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any signs .
what a horrible experience !
however , just the other night , i found mold in my pizza .
customer service sucks .
will not be eating little caesars ever again .
service here sucked .
i can excuse the mess because i know how inconsiderate customers can be .
other than that i do n't know who else could appreciate this place .
so in conclusion , this store ... do n't , just ... do n't .
merchandise is really outdated .
this is the inventory that no one wanted .
no sales help , very depressing .
do n't plan on finding quality product at low prices .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
employees were overly rude , inconsiderate and unprofessional .
they tried telling us we drove _num_ miles !
really disappointed with the service at this location .
when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .
they were rude and unapologetic .
so basically their guarantee is that there is no guarantee .
be polite on the phone , then hang up and talk crap about them .
would n't recommend this dentist to anyone .
the equipment they had was really outdated and painful .
why schedule appointments if you ca n't be ready to serve your patients ?
not like they 're doing the work for free !
office max has officially lost my business .
they do n't have my ink .
they do n't carry my series number ( _num_ ) only up to _num_ .
we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .
it was a empty bar .
walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only .
so i was a little disappointed at this point .
it was n't horrible tasting food , just bland for what i prefer .
going in with coworkers for a quick bite to eat i ordered the nachos .
i pushed ignore .
but there came a point that i could ignore no more .
things were not right .
the food is not cooked all the way , and , none wears gloves .
i hate to give them just _num_ star .
it was terrible .
i seriously feel so gross right now after eating there tonight .
they are rude and dirty .
this is a warning : do n't go there !
but i have to get this off my chest .
sammy is my normal barber but he messed my hair up horribly yesterday .
i gave him the same instructions on how to cut my hair like always .
i will never be back to metro barber shop and not give anymore referrals .
you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .
_num_ star for that and another for the yummy biscuits .
not cuz of the hair but because of the mediocre food .
disappointing .
bland .
no flavor .
and its not the first time that service was bad there .
ok , all done with red lobster for a good long while now .
host was friendly , waiter jeremy was super nice and manager was all smiles .
it was pretty odd for an almost empty restaurant .
i used to love the mussels appetizer , but this visit they were awful .
the coconut shrimp was ok .
i went to red lobster today with my family the service was horrible .
my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of muscles were closed .
it was our first time at red lobster , and probably our last .
for app , we got the stuffed mushrooms with shrimp and lobster .
but , the shrimp linguini totally blew .
absolutely terrible service from our waitress .
waited _num_ minutes just for bread .
will not be coming back .
the hostess was very unfriendly .
they would n't remove it from our bill nor offer any discounts .
extremely disappointed .
this place sucks !
i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed .
with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected .
the meat was like a lunch meat instead of real sliced deli beef .
could hardly find the mozzarella either .
only good thing was the toasted bun .
do not stop here if you are wanting fast service .
bad bad bad !
do not stay here .
shame i ca n't give this place a lower review .
the management was rude .
the toilet in the room did n't stop running .
i wo n't be staying here ever again .
there is no plug for the the drain .
i asked if i could get one from an empty room .
the bathroom was disgusting .
the only thing worse than the room was the staff .
i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .
do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .
worst hotel experience ever .
i say again , do n't ever ever ever ever stay at this hotel !
i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .
just got a peter piper pizza for the 1st time in awhile .
i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .
too bad .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
why why why ?
the wings are sorry .
if this is a recipe change it is not a good one .
the manager , steve , was very rude .
i totally agree but the way he said it was very arrogant .
when we received our order of wings , they were cold .
he was a total ass .
and the cashier was a complete bitch .
her attitude was disgusting .
so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .
making my wings get cold as i waited for the pizza to get done .
lots of issues with the games not working and not giving tickets out .
my food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time .
the salad was heavy on the onions , easy on the anything else .
i do n't understand why they do n't do dressing either .
so the salad was a fail .
for the soup , i went with the chicken & gnocchi .
it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... so only a minor fail .
food arrives , everything is normal , whatever .
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
i strongly suggest something ( anything ) else .
may i recommend the apricot chicken or mixed grill ?
there where _num_ waiters , still service was slow .
both waiters where rude and condescending .
horrible service !
walked in and was told there was a 10-15 minute wait .
sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after i did .
she said , sorry you 're next .
night was ruined before i got my food .
i would normally give og a 3-4 .
first bite was great , then my wife commented that it was bleeding .
so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .
i used to love olive garden but its become so blah .
so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .
not thrilled with this place , probably wo n't come here again .
she was not even friendly !
heavy sauces , bland dishes and so-so service .
also , someone said the regulars are a joy to hang out with ?
maybe i am just visiting at the wrong time .
so i do not recommend this location plus , they hardly have anything .
the selection was better but probably because it 's a ghost town at metro .
do n't go to this metro location .
this place was filthy !
we found _num_ in a corner , the rest was n't cleaned .
several trays were empty , and were not refilled .
)
no words for this experience .
never again in this dump .
so disappointing .
the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .
fried shrimp was over cooked .
when i first walked in , i was hit with that bathroom smell .
the food looked old , the lettuce wilted , it just looked gross .
the bread wasnt too bad .
yes , hoping someone would hear me .
there are three left and i believe this is the worst of them .
we gave up on getting him off our backs and walked out without ordering .
worst experience ever !
waiter dropped off food and never came back !
did n't care if we needed anything .
the chicken alfredo was nasty .
sauce tastes old and left over .
$ _num_ for two _num_ oz steaks _num_ salad bar .
absolute no seasoning on the nasty meat .
crappy buffet .
at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .
luckily no one here cares that they serve you horrible food .
the food was awful .
the steak had absolutely no taste .
there is a texas roadhouse around the corner .
unfortunately we will never make the mistakes of going to this location again !
food was warm that was suppose to be cold and chicken wings were old .
overall a bad experience for _num_ bucks !
big mistake .
nothing was working .
her potato was burnt and dry .
her entire meal was horrible .
unhappy and unsatisfied .
awful , food sits and is old .
i asked for a to go box for a left over roll and shrimp .
the waiter said i could n't take the shrimp home because it was unlimited .
to the lazy manager you lost a loyal customer over shrimp !
so for _num_ , i would skip this place !
i was so very disappointed .
i could n't even bring myself to finish one bowl .
to make matters worse , the place has all the atmosphere of a warehouse .
hardly any sauces , and it 's totally ugly inside .
their pineapple was bad .
avoid this place .
it 's a shame to watch this place take the turn it has .
i opted for the cod .
not a fan .
but i am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered .
it seemed gross and chewy .
_num_ .
_num_ .
upon entering , the atmosphere was just ok .
there was nothing special .
it simply did n't `` hit the spot '' so to speak .
it was a _num_ dollar bowl for crying out loud .
i declined the box and left my leftovers at the restaurant .
honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .
all i ate there was crunchy rice and soy sauce .
i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .
there 's no chance i will ever be back .
guess it 's not my thing .
even the ice cream for dessert lacks luster .
no toppings , just soft serve vanilla ice cream .
to be honest the only thing that was good was the fountain drinks .
maybe mongolian grills are not my thing .
there was no one else in there .
lame .
went tonight on a recognition and was horribly disappointed .
this does n't even come close .
the meats looked like frozen , rolled up lunch meat .
my man did n't even finish his good and that never happens .
even the frozen yogurt did n't taste very good .
wow this place is bad .
the cashier asked who is going to eat because there is not sharing ?
also they do not have gluten free soy sauce .
i would stay away from this restaurant .
not worth the money .
we will not be back !
$ _num_ plus tax for two people , one bowl each !
worst mongolian bbq i 've ever had .
this restaurant was very disappointing .
this place was by far the worst .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very limited choices in regards to meat , vegetables , and sauces .
_num_ .
the broccoli tasted like it was not washed .
_num_ .
this even longer story short , they changed my oil .
i hate it .
i have never not had to wait in a 10+ minute wait line .
this is the absolute worst walgreens i 've ever been to .
they do n't have a separate person working the drive through window .
do n't come here without expecting do wait over _num_ mins .
this pharmacy is awful .
do not trust the minute clinic website !
their pharmacy staff are very rude , slow and unprofessional .
walgreen 's is dead to me .
pharmacy staff is rude .
that 's too bad .
which is pretty sad since it 's for children .
the customer service there was awful .
the place did n't even do anything for the birthday girl .
but , the food was terrible .
there were bad grapes mixed in with good ones .
and the salad looked old .
chuck e cheese is our typical friday outing .
so we she did get to see him but almost by force .
no eggs no green olives ect and paid almost ten dollars !
so got off from a _num_ hour shift pretty hungry .
got the salad , it was ok .
there was comes a time when you make bad choices .
so gross today .
like they do n't give a crap .
we will not be coming back .
i am not exaggerating .
for something that was their fault so we got our prescription and left .
horrible service and ethics !
zero stars just the middle finger .
after _num_ minutes , the call was dropped .
why would n't she tell me that from the beginning ?
wrong !
i have never felt so damn uncomfortable in my life !
not joking _num_ freakin minutes i was in there and i was gone .
horrible !
Very negative
if i could give negative rating omg i would .
it was totally bland and was overwhelmed with ricotta cheese .
the wings were just gross .
they were a soggy , greasy , tasteless mess .
the wings sucked .
i spent _num_ bucks there .
this place is horrible !
food is n't good .
service is n't good .
edit : hi rick , i appreciate your desire for a resolution .
under it 's current management it 's a complete ripoff .
not impressed .
assuming that they had it on file , i didnt even ask .
failure one was not checking the address or even bothering to take one .
the food has never been much more than convenient .
do n't give them your business .
i could not believe it .
it literally ruined my night .
so disappointed !
tonight was terrible !
the owner wo n't return calls and the staff wo n't help .
worst delivery ever .
order _num_ simple things was told 30-45 min which is find .
the lady that answered was extremely rude and did n't care one dam bit .
really over an hour behind and nothing .
got off the phone another _num_ min later the driver got to our house .
i , along with a couple of friends visited this place last friday night .
anyway , the service lacked in every way .
pizza was disgusting .
rude management , tasteless food , overpriced .
do n't waste your time or money here .
yuck , yuck yuck .
i 've been wanting chicken fingers all day .
i also asked for hot sauce , guess what i got instead ?
like wtf am i going to do with cherry sauce ?
i ca n't do this place & will never recommend it to anyone .
$ _num_ wasted on this place .
the coupon says it 's only good tonight at the game .
stand in line and get to the front but no pizza .
manager says she needs it for inventory .
long time streets customer who is now done with them for a long time .
my pizza was cold .
over cooked and disgusting .
get a life , worse pizza in town !
food was disgusting , raw chicken , cold and soggy .
we literally could n't eat our dinner .
no wonder the food was so bad .
looked at the bottom of container barely any sauce .
so sad .
this is the worst excuse for italian food ever .
honestly , i would only leave zero stars if i could .
i just had a horrible experience with this location .
then an hour goes by no food .
another _num_ minutes goes by .
no apologies , nothing .
and food is cold , soggy , not edible by any means .
this was a waste of time .
worst food and customer service ever .
big mistake .
i guess that is not the case .
now , the one advantage i thought was present , is not .
i took my _num_ yr old dog into her first teeth cleaning last week .
my poor pup , with no teeth at only _num_ yrs old .
i hate them for not giving me the option by calling me first .
this is a corporate vet and everything bad that corporate vets do .
i do n't know how else to put it .
so of course i am going to use the vet visit .
it is all about up sale and scare tactics at this vet .
which i expected , i have been to corporate vets before .
i should not have gone .
one of the worst animal hospitals i have ever been too !
if we had waited any longer , they all would have been dead !
bye bye forever mean people !
horrible customer service .
a month later , i still had not received my dryer back .
fed up i called the district manager .
i told him that is not my issue .
i pay my bill monthly on time .
after all , i am the customer .
this store sucks .
i would n't recommend it to anyone .
after they hook you , they do n't care .
from outside this place looks sketchy at best .
the place looks gross , old and not clean at all .
we decided on may _num_ , _num_ .
what a shame of a business you are running linda .
i will be contacting groupon to get a refund .
i wo n't come back .
this on the other hand was a disaster from the beginning .
i 'm not even kidding , it was falling off .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
do n't buy the groupon .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
make sure you have time to burn , my mani/pedi took over two hours !
i called the salon before purchasing the groupon to check their availability .
the customer service that i experienced here was on par with any other salon .
however , this is a school .
as such , the quality and consistency of the services are not reliable .
it is simply awful .
i was very disappointed with my manicure .
my pedicure , however , turned out okay with minimal polish on the skin .
i would not recommend this salon , nor will i be returning .
when entering , i was willing to give the techs a chance .
usually , i could use my groupon right away but whatever '' .
i washed my hands _num_ times that night .
this is easily the worst motel _num_ i have ever stayed in .
i do n't care if it 's only $ _num_ .
it 's not good here .
not so good .
the manager was nice enough - no big deal .
i kept telling her no but she continued to insist she must come in .
of course , i called management and they said they would security immediately .
no child or baby here .
it was weird .
but no one told me !
the front desk never called to check if the situation had been resolved .
do n't stay here .
it 's just too weird .
i really do n't know if it was water .
the water was barely flowing .
this was beyond unacceptable !
worst motel ever !
lots of shady people out and about .
cops always seem to be here .
not a family friendly place at all .
no bed bugs in my room though !
but i do n't feel my vehicle is safe outside .
the carpet had at least _num_ stains .
drug deals out in the parking lot .
the maids left the trash in the hallways all night .
trash every where .
my boyfriend and i recently drove cross country .
we picked _num_ cities to stop in while driving .
this hotel was the worst hotel we stayed in .
the area seemed very sketchy .
i am glad we only stayed one night here .
if i ever come to phoenix to visit i will not be staying here .
this hotel sucks .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
thank god we left at _num_ _num_ the next morning .
bathroom looks like it had never been cleaned , ever .
outside smells _num_ times better than my room did .
maintenance replaced the phone .
the next morning , we found that the water temperature would n't stay steady .
could n't get out of the there fast enough .
this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in and felt very unsafe .
i reserved a room with _num_ double beds no smoking .
the front door was broken off of the cabinet that held the fridge .
that was the only good thing about this place .
call the front desk and request one , this is approx .
7:30 am , i am told i will have to wait till _num_ am .
i would rather be dirty than stay one more min in this place .
the worst place i ever stayed .
second night the room was not cleaned and no towels .
just uncomfortable .
my pillow case had a burned hole in it .
the non-smoking room reeked , but that was n't even the start .
the sheets , comforter , and towels were stained .
ridiculous .
i 've stayed at other super _num_ before and it was n't like this .
by far one of the worst shopping experiences i 've ever had .
it 's ghetto and the service is incredibly horrible .
i 'm never going there again .
i highly recommend that you never go here unless you want to get frustrated .
half the lights do n't work .
floor and ceiling look like they have been rode hard and hung up wet .
online pick up you better be ready for long delays .
no wonder they are closing down everywhere .
waited _num_ minutes at the service desk .
there were no check-out lanes open .
never was waited on while the service desk person took customers out of order .
i may shop there again - not ( unless pig 's fly ) .
yo yelp people - why is n't there a zero star rating ?
this place is terrible !
_num_ hours later it was ready .
nobody called me .
how absurd !
got a groupon deal that said i would get a synthetic blend oil change .
manager said i could pay more to get a synthetic o change .
made an appointment to get my oil changed at 8am on june 2nd .
i asked them how long it would take ryan told me _num_ mins .
what i was not fine with .
nor will anyone else i know .
_num_ and a half hours for a quoted _num_ min oil change .
it would have been fine or i would have went else where .
very rude , will not come back .
but nothing show stopping .
i would n't go here for a meal ever again .
never again will i go back to this restaurant .
i am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill .
the food here is n't very good .
it has n't been for quite a few years .
the service the last time i went was just terrible .
i guess i need to spell that out more clearly next time .
these donuts have the perfect texture and taste .
good food for the price .
a little dirty on the inside , but wonderful people that work there !
i always order it when i go there and it is always awesome .
the rest of the food there is good also and not very expensive .
great food , low prices , and huge quantity !
so excited to have a chinese place near my office !
this is my go to spot for chinese food .
i also really enjoy the won ton soup and combo fried rice .
the pepper steak is another good one .
everything always seems to be really fresh and the prices are reasonable !
i love the soup .
worth the price thats for sure .
will keep returning .
best place ever .
the orange chicken is a must .
